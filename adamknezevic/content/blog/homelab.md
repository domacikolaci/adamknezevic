## So, you want the joys of being a sysadmin at home to huh?

After finishing a day of hard work being the best sys admin you can at work, who would want nothing more then doing it all over again at home! :)

Cynicism aside, labbing at home can be very fun and rewarding, both for improving life at home with additional services in your life (be it Jellyfin to centralise all your home media, or HomeAssistant helping bridge the gaps that come with IoT devices), as well as also to learn and develop your skills as an IT professional.

Feel like stepping foot into Linux tonight? Cool! Make a new VM with Ubuntu Server and get going!

Want to try your hand at SIEM? Sweet! Spin up a Wazuh instance and lets get started pushing agents out onto all your endpoints at home!
