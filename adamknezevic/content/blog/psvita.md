## I love homebrew

I f*ing love homebrew. I love what it does to consoles that would otherwise be forgotten about. There is something oddly satisfying tinkering with a console and making it play games that should never have been playable to begin with. Or running entire operating systems that were never intended to be ran on said system.

Recently, I purchased a Vita and boooyyy is this thing fun to hack. Got this thing now running the entier PSP OS
