## I love homebrew

I f*ing love homebrew. I love what it does to consoles that would otherwise be forgotten about. There is something oddly satisfying tinkering with a console and making it play games that should never have been playable to begin with. Or running entire operating systems that were never intended to be ran on said system.

Recently, I purchased a Vita and boooyyy is this thing fun to hack. Got this thing now running the entier PSP OS


# Guide

The best thing to do with starting off is checking in with the site vita.hacks.guide as this site will contain the most up to date methods for modding the vita (including the recent discovery for 1000 models where you dont need an official memory card anymore since you can make a 1GB partition now from the system storage)
