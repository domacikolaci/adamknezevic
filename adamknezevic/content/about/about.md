## The rundown

Currently I am a IT network security engineer and project resource for one of Australia's larget MSP's, Virtual IT Group (VITG).

I am a avid explorer of all things "computers". My entire experience and knowledge is based on simply pushing buttons to see what they do, how they operate and if something explodes.... why?

## Experience

The quick summary would be,

- 6+ years working in the MSP (Managed Service Provider) industry.
- Network administration and deployments for Meraki, WatchGuard and Fortinet.
- SentinelOne configuration, deployment and monitoring.
- Network security assesments.
- Monitoring for and responding to security indcidents, as well as working on remediation and post remediation for said incidents.
- Managing and monitoring Windows and Linux endpoints.
- Windows and Linux server administration.
- Scoping and deploying networks, firewalls and servers for small to medium buisnesses.

## Hobbies

Main activites you will find me doing in my spare time would be either playing video games (Currently playing alot of Hitman 3 and Elder Scrolls Online), collecting and modding retro consoles and playing the card game Magic The Gathering (I know, what a nerd....).

Otherwise, if I am not doing any of that in my spare time I am often just tinkering around with either my PC or my servers. I always seem to find something new on the internet that sparks my curiosity and desire to tinker and play with it, be it a new security product or some new form of pen testing tool or even just a simple service to add to the ever growing Docker collection on my servers for the home lab.
