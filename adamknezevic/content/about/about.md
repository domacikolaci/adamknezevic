## The rundown

Currently I am aIT network security engineer and project resource for one of Australia's larget MSP's, Virtual IT Group (VITG).

I am a avid explorer of all things "computers". My entire experience and knowledge is based on simply pushing buttons to see what they do, how they operate and if something explodes.... why?
